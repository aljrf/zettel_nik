# Zettelkasten workflow

Here are the basic steps to follow when using the Zettelkasten note-taking system:

1. **Capture**: Whenever you come across a new idea or piece of information, write it down. Each Zettel should contain a single idea, and should be labeled with a unique identifier.
2. **Organize**: Once you have a collection of notes, you can start organizing them. Consolidate your fleeting notes, and turn them into permanent notes. Create reference notes to keep track of everything. 
3. **Connect**: One of the key benefits of Zettelkasten is the ability to connect related ideas together. Look for ways to link your individual notes together, either by creating new connections or identifying existing ones. If you’re using a digital app for this, you can use tags. If you’re doing this physically, you can mark a corner of the note (with a color, symbol, or code) to connect them.
4. **Review**: Regularly review your Zettelkasten to ensure that it remains organized and up-to-date. Look for new connections between your notes, and add new ideas as they come to you.
5. **Apply**: Finally, use your Zettelkasten to generate new insights and ideas. By combining and recombining your notes in new ways, you can gain a deeper understanding of complex topics and generate new ideas.
